    Write hello_with_time.php script to display the current date as well as the time.Comment your code for readability. (Hint: With the date() function, you can use M to display the month name, j to display the day of the month, and Y to display the year.)
    Write a script that creates a variable and assigns an integer value to it, then adds 1 to the variable ’ s value three times, using a different operator each time. Display the final result to the user.
    Write a script that creates two variables and assigns a different integer value to each variable. Now make your script test whether the first value is
        equal to the second value
        greater than the second value
        less than or equal to the second value
        not equal to the second value and output the result of each test to the user.
    Write a script that counts from 1 to 10 in steps of 1. For each number, display whether that number is an odd or even number, and also display a message if the number is a prime number. Display this information within an HTML table.
    A factorial of any given integer, n , is the product of all positive integers between 1 and n inclusive. So the factorial of 4 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24, and the factorial of 5 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120. This can be expressed recursively as follows:
    If n == 0, return 1. (This is the base case)
    If n > 0, compute the factorial of n – 1, multiply it by n , and return the result
    Write a PHP script that uses a recursive function to display the factorials of the integers 0 to 10.
    Write a simple number - guessing game in PHP. The script should “ think ” of a random number between 1 and 100, then give the user five chances to guess the number. For each guess, the script should report whether the guessed number was too low, too high, or correct. (Hint: Use rand( 1, 100 ) to generate a random number between 1 and 100.)
